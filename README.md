# multi-cycle-RISC-processor
This project develops a RISC multi-cycle processor using the Verilog hardware description language and the active-HDL software tool. It implements five stages processor's architecture.

This project aims to develop a RISC multi-cycle processor using the Verilog hardware description
language and the active-HDL software tool. The project implements all the theoretical and
practical aspects involved in creating a processorâ€™s architecture, featuring five stages: fetch,
decode, ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), memory access, and write back. And supporting a
predefined set of instructions and includes specific information and properties.

The report offers a comprehensive overview of the developmental stages involved in the design of
the Central Processing Unit (CPU). This encompasses instruction analysis, writing instruction
Register-Transfer Level (RTL) descriptions, transforming RTL into functional components, RICS
machine design, and the implementation of Datapath and control signals.

Furthermore, the report explores the validation of the CPU's functionality through various testing
methodologies, such as testbenches, and the execution of programs to ensure both accuracy and
performance of the designed CPU.
